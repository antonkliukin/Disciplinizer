# Disciplinizer

The app was developed from scratch by me. 
It was available in the Russian App Store for some time but then got removed as I had no time to support it. 

App's architectural approach was inspired by https://github.com/FortechRomania/ios-mvp-clean-architecture and https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html

### App features

1) Users can set a time during which they are not allowed to use their phones;
2) The app can detect if users leave it while the timer is active;
3) In case of leaving the app for more than 10 seconds - users fail the session, otherwise, they successfully finish it;
4) To foster their motivation users can use two types of motivators: a digital pet or spending time watching ads;
5) In case an ads mode was chosen and the session failed - users must watch a couple of ads to continue using the app;
6) In case a pet mode was chosen and the session failed - users lose a digital pet. They can buy a new one using in-app purchases. That's why this motivator is considered to be the strongest;
7) To encourage users it was decided to give away 50% of income from in-app purchases to animals welfare organizations;
